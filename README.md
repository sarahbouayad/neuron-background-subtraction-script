# Neuron Background Subtraction Script 

## This repository contains a Python script to process corneal neuron images and remove background noise caused by white overlap between single-neuron (green) and all-neuron (magenta) fluorescent labels. The goal is to extract high-quality single-neuron signals while preserving neuron structure.
